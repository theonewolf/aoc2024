# Advent of Code 2024

I return to the annual tradition, this time programming in whatever language I
want---no set theme!

I will probably ping pong between Python and C# depending on the datastructures
I need.

Let's see!

# Setup for Python

1. `python -mvenv aoc`
2. `. aoc/bin/activage.fish`
3. `pip install --upgrade pip`
4. `pip install -e .`
